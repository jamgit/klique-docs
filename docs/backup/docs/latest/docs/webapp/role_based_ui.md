# Role-Based UI

> The Klique WebApp's three role-based views, AI Admin, AI Builder, and AI Consumer, and how to switch between them.

The Klique WebApp presents its features through three role-filtered views,
each tailored to a different persona:

* [**AI Admin**](#ai-admin) - Platform operators managing the tenant: users, access,
  infrastructure, and tenant-wide activity.
* [**AI Builder**](#ai-builder) - Users running and managing ML workloads: tasks, datasets,
  pipelines, and applications.
* [**AI Consumer**](#ai-consumer) - End users of published applications.

A single tenant sign-in covers every view the user is entitled to. An admin has
access to all three views; a builder has access to the Builder and Consumer views;
a consumer has access only to the Consumer view.

## Switching Views

Users can switch to any view they are entitled to. To switch views, click the profile menu button

in the top right corner and select the desired view. 

Switching views changes the sidebar and default landing page; it does not change the user's permissions.
An on-screen indicator always shows which view is currently in effect.

## AI Admin

The AI Admin view exposes tenant administration functionality:
* Managing users and access
* Operating cluster infrastructure
* Monitoring tenant-wide activity
 
The sidebar organizes it into:

* **[Dashboard](webapp_admin_dashboard.md)** - Tenant-wide activity, organized into:
  * [Running Tasks](webapp_admin_dashboard_running_tasks.md) - Running tasks and app instances across the tenant
  * [Metering](webapp_admin_dashboard_metering.md) - Usage and spend based on custom events metered by the server
  * [AI Usage](webapp_admin_dashboard_ai_usage.md) - LLM token consumption across the workspace
* **[Orchestration](webapp_workers_queues.md)** - Cluster-wide queues, workers, autoscalers,
  and [resource policies](resource_policies.md).
* **[Settings](admin_settings.md)** - Tenant administration settings, including:
  * Users and groups
  * Access rules
  * Identity providers
  * Administrator vaults
  * Storage volumes and cleanup
  * Metering service
  * Application gateway
  * LLM Gateway
  * Resource configuration
  * UI customization.

The default landing page is the [Dashboard](webapp_admin_dashboard.md).

## AI Builder

The AI Builder view exposes functionality for building and running ML workloads: 
* Experiments
* Datasets
* Pipelines
* Applications
* Model endpoints

The sidebar organizes it into:

* **[Projects](webapp_projects_page.md)** - Tasks, models, dataviews, and [reports](webapp_reports.md), with the [Project Dashboard](webapp_home.md) as the entry point.
* **[Datasets](datasets/webapp_dataset_page.md)** - Dataset management
* **[Pipelines](pipelines/webapp_pipeline_page.md)** - Pipeline runs and management
* **[Applications](applications/apps_overview.md)** - Klique UI applications
* **[Model Endpoints](webapp_model_endpoints.md)** - Live model endpoints the user can access
* **[Orchestration](webapp_workers_queues.md)** - Queues, workers, and resource policies the user can access

The default landing page is the [Project Dashboard](webapp_home.md).

## AI Consumer

The AI Consumer view provides access only to published [applications](applications/apps_overview.md), allowing users to 
run them without the surrounding development and administration functionality.
