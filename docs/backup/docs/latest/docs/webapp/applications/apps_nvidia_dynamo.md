# Nvidia Dynamo

> NVIDIA's Dynamo serving framework, deployed as a multi-service stack of ETCD, NATS, frontend, and workers serving multiple LLMs behind one endpoint.

The NVIDIA Dynamo application enables users to deploy and serve multiple LLM models simultaneously over a unified, 
load-balanced endpoint. Built on [NVIDIA's Dynamo](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo) serving framework, the 
application orchestrates a set of infrastructure services with one or more GPU-backed inference workers to provide 
scalable, multi-model inference serving. 

The application consists of the following components:

* ETCD service - Maintains a lightweight registry of all running models and replicas. Inference workers periodically report their status to this service  
* NATS service - Handles internal communication between the Dynamo Frontend and inference workers.   
* Dynamo Frontend - public-facing gateway for all incoming model requests. Requests are received through a static gateway route and are forwarded to the target inference worker through NATS.   
* Inference workers - GPU-backed workers that run individual models using a selected serving backend. Multiple worker configurations can be deployed simultaneously, allowing different models and serving engines to run within the same application instance. 

When a request is sent to the application endpoint, the Dynamo Frontend receives the request, routes it through the NATS messaging layer, and forwards it to the appropriate inference worker. Worker state and availability are tracked through ETCD. 

The application supports multiple inference backends, including vLLM, SGLang, and TensorRT-LLM. Each inference worker can be configured independently with its own model, serving engine, Docker image, and replica count.

When autoscaling is enabled, the application can automatically increase or decrease the number of inference worker replicas based on configurable CPU, GPU, RAM, VRAM, and disk I/O utilization thresholds. 

:::info[AI Application Gateway]
The Nvidia Dynamo app makes use of the App Gateway Router which implements a secure, authenticated network endpoint for 
the model.

If the Klique AI Application Gateway is not available, the model endpoint might not be accessible. For more information, see
[AI Application Gateway](../../whats_klique/appgw.md).

Once you start an NVIDIA Dynamo instance, you can view the following information in its dashboard:

* Status indicator  
  *  - App instance is running and is actively in use
  *  - App instance is setting up
  *  - App instance is idle
  *  - App instance is stopped
* Idle time  - Time elapsed since last activity   
* Generate Token - Link to the `AI APPLICATION GATEWAY` section of the Settings page, where you can generate a token for authenticating requests to the deployed models  
* Service tasks - Task ID and console log links for each of the three core services:  
  * ETCD Task  
  * NATS Task  
  * Frontend Task  
* Workers - List of inference worker instances, labeled by serving engine and model (e.g., `vllm — Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B [1]`)  
* Command to connect to the deployed model  
  * Select model to generate a curl command for connecting to it  
  * Prompt - Provide a prompt to send to the model. This will be added to the curl command  
  * The generated curl command includes the model's endpoint and prompt. Replace `YOUR_GENERATED_TOKEN` with a valid 
    token generated in the `AI APPLICATION GATEWAY` section of the [Settings](../settings/webapp_settings_profile.md#ai-application-gateway-tokens) page.  
* Node Summary – Overview of all application nodes, including service nodes and inference worker nodes.  
* GPU Worker Status - Number of inference workers in each status category   
* Resource utilization plots over time:  
  * CPU Compute Utilization  
  * GPU Compute Utilization  
  * CPU Memory Utilization  
  * GPU Memory Utilization  
* Console Log – The console log shows the app instance's setup progress, status changes, error messages, etc.

:::tip[Embedding Visualizations]
You can embed plots from the app instance dashboard into [Reports](../webapp_reports.md). Klique 
also supports embedding resources in third-party platforms that support embedded content (e.g. Notion). These visualizations 
are updated live as the app instance(s) updates. Hover over the plot and click  
to copy the embed code, and navigate to a report to paste the embed code.

## Dynamo App Instance Configuration

When configuring a new Dynamo App instance, you can fill in the required parameters or reuse the 
configuration of a previously launched instance. 

Launch an app instance with the configuration of a previously launched instance using one of the following options:
* Cloning a previously launched app instance will open the instance launch form with the original instance's 
configuration prefilled.
* Importing an app configuration file. You can export the configuration of a previously launched instance as a JSON file 
when viewing its configuration.

The prefilled configuration form can be edited before launching the new app instance.

To configure a new app instance, click `Launch New`  
to open the app's configuration form.

### Configuration Options

**:::note**  
Administrators can [customize](../../deploying_klique/app_launch_form_custom.md) the launch form and modify field names and/or available options and defaults.

This section describes the default configuration provided by Klique.  
:::

* **Import Configuration** - Import an app instance configuration file. This will fill the instance launch form with the values from the file, which can be modified before launching the app instance.  
* **Instance Name** - Name for the app instance. This will appear in the instance list. If not set, defaults to `NVIDIA Dynamo_<timestamp>`.  
* **Service Project - Access Control** - The Klique project where the app instance is created. App instance network access is determined by project-level permissions (i.e. users with read access can access app endpoints).   
* **ETCD Service**  
  * **Queue** - The [Klique Queue](https://clear.ml/docs/latest/docs/fundamentals/agents_and_queues/#what-is-a-queue) serviced by the Klique Orchestrator which will run the ETCD service container.   
  * **Docker Image** - Docker image used to run the ETCD service. Must include `bash` and Python. The `etcd` binary is downloaded at startup via the setup script.  
* **NATS Service**  
  * **Queue** - The [Klique Queue](https://clear.ml/docs/latest/docs/fundamentals/agents_and_queues/#what-is-a-queue) serviced by the Klique Orchestrator which will run the NATS container.

* **Inference Workers -** Configure the inference workers to deploy. Multiple worker configurations can be added to serve different models simultaneously.  
  * **Queue** - The [Klique Queue](https://clear.ml/docs/latest/docs/fundamentals/agents_and_queues/#what-is-a-queue) serviced by the Klique Orchestrator which will run the inference worker. The agent must have GPU access and the NVIDIA Dynamo runtime image available.  
  * **Deployment Type** - Select inference backend to use (e.g. vLLM, SGLang, TensorRT-LLM).   
  * **Model** - HuggingFace model name  (e.g. `Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B`). The model will be downloaded to `/models` inside the worker container.
